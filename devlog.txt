Added devise, model user - simple can sign up, logout etc.
No verification of e-mail yet

2012-08-26
Added CanCan. Added Roles and an SuperAdmin in the dev db.

2012-09-09
Added missing controller for session management now with cancan active.
Also added two new users, karl-petter@yelloworb.com and kalle@yelloworb.com
Also made the first SuperAdmin.
- rails c
- kp = User.find_by_email('karl-petter@yelloworb.com')
- kp.roles << Role.find_by_name(:superadmin)
- kp.save!

Designing sign up/registration process:
- admin creates user based on e-mail(no mail is sent out) if user does not exist
- admin registers a new station assigned to the user, email is sent out
OR
- user creates an account or has a previous account
- buys a station and admin register station, email is sent out

created a gmail account to send out mail from yelloworbwebapp@gmail.com, same password as webapp@yelloworb.com
Tried to add invitations https://github.com/scambra/devise_invitable but it crashes when creating a new station without setting owner from dropdown

Verify the the invitation Gem works
Add will_paginate Gem
Add a calendar to select a date to delete data older than that date

Add check of IMEI http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mobile_Equipment_Identity


start working on issue 5:
A user can edit position and name of his/her stations
 - add to user has_many stations
Add an admin role
An admin can edit any station
An admin can add new stations, IMEI only, defaults to noname and no-position, not poistioned flag?

Add testing - guard and spork

- change so stations are identified by stationnames rather than id number
